title: TS Simple AST - Documentation
---

## Purpose

Setup, navigation, and manipulation of the TypeScript AST can be a challenge. This library wraps the TypeScript compiler so it's simple.

## System Requirements

* Environment with support for ES6 (Node v6.10+)

## Installing

You must additionally install the correct TypeScript compiler version as specified in the library's peer dependencies.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript@2.2.2
npm install --save-dev ts-simple-ast
```

## Documentation Progress (Updated: 16 June 2017)

I've been still slowly updating the documentation. I'm keeping it up to date with any new features, but some existing features don't have documentation.

This should be up to speed in about two months.

**Next step:** [Setup](setup/index)
