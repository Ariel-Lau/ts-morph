title: TS Simple AST - Documentation
---

## Purpose

Setup, navigation, and manipulation of the TypeScript AST can be a challenge. This library wraps the TypeScript compiler so it's simple.

## System Requirements

* Environment with support for ES6 (Node v6.10+)

## Installing

You must additionally install the correct TypeScript compiler version as specified in the library's peer dependencies.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript@2.2.2
npm install --save-dev ts-simple-ast
```

## Documentation Progress (Updated: 15 April 2017)

The documentation should be correct right now, but a lot of the library is missing documentation. There's still a lot of work to do here.

I'm going to work towards getting the documentation up to date slowly.

Also, I need a better design and layout. This was quickly thrown together. I'm no designer :)

**Next step:** [Setup](setup/index)
